# Welcome to Sensible!
Sensible is an app made to make diabetic neuropathy screening more accessible. It brings
the gold standard VPT test into a an app form factor, relaying changes in neuropathy to
the patient's healthcare provider. In doing so we hope to enable early intervention and
prevent diabetic amputations.

Designed as part of the fall 2024 Texas Convergent build team competition; named best product & pitch.
